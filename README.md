# Quick "Who I am" ?

May name is Daniel M.  
While I am coming from health/fitness background I've been involved in blockchain-related projects for 6+ years.  
My goals are to become more versed in fintech and eventually snag a job in the field upon completing the bootcamp and/or getting more knowledge in this area.  
I have always been a "numbers kind of guy" even though my degree is in something different.  
Emerging markets such as finance on the blockchain are exciting as it removes the middle man from an area of ourt lives that has been hugely dependent upon the knowledge of a few. Digital banking, for example, lets people get behind the steering wheel so they can become the handlers of their own financial wealth.
